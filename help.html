                        designed
                        and built by a group of dedicated students as
                        part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.

                        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work,
                        limit
                        work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban
                        to
                        help
                        users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
