            <div class="headline">What is <span class="join">Join</span>?</div>
            <div class="text-help"><span class="join">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed
                and built by a group of dedicated students as
                part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
                <br><br>
                Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban to help
                users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
                <br><br>
                It is important to note that <span class="join">Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise
                and is not intended for
                extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot

            <div class="headline">How to use it</div>
            <div class="text-help-guide">Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="join">Join</span>:
            </div>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Exploring the Board</h4>
                    When you log in to <span class="join">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board
                    represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await
                    feedback” and "Done".
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Creating Contacts</h4>
                    In <span class="join">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to
                    the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once
                    added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Adding Cards</h4>
                    Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual
                    tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task
                    details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Moving Cards</h4>
                    As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
                    dropping the card from one list to another.Deleting Cards
                    Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a
                    card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as
                    this action is irreversible.

                    Remember that using <span class="join">Join</span> effectively requires consistent updates from
                    you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current state of your project.
